# This script generates core-gene alignments from a list of assemblies.
# Created by Asher Preska Steinberg (apsteinberg@nyu.edu).
# Usage: PangenomeAlignmentGenerate <assembly summary file> <accession list file> <output direcotry> <output prefix>
# Arguments:
#   <assembly summary file> can be download from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/assembly_summary_refseq.txt
#   <accession list file> contains a list of assembly accessions;
#   <output directory> is the working space;
#   <output prefix> is the result output_prefix.
# Results:
#   <output directory>/<output prefix>_CORE <output_prefix>_FLEX stores the final alignments of core and accessory genes
# This program contains six steps as detailed below.
