# CollectPangenomeAlignments
This program collects gene alignments from multiple FASTA files
that have been aligned to a pangenome reference file generated by Roary.
Largely based on CollectGeneAlignments code by Mingzhi Lin (mingzhi9@gmail.com),
 re-purposed for pangenome alignment by Asher Preska Steinberg (apsteinberg@nyu.edu).
